        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mother's recipe for authentic German potato salad. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if there are, they don't last long!</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups diced peeled potatoes</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and add water to cover by at least 1 to 2 inches; bring to a boil. Cook until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>While the potatoes are cooking, place bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, 10 to 12 minutes, turning as needed. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate and crumble when cool enough to handle. Leave bacon grease in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Cook onion in the bacon grease over medium heat until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add vinegar, sugar, water, salt, and pepper to the pan and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiling, add potatoes, and 1/2 of the crumbled bacon. Cook until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer warm potato salad to a serving dish and sprinkle remaining crumbled bacon over top. Garnish with parsley and serve warm.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
