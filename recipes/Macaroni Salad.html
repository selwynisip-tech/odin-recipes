        <h2>This sweet macaroni salad is, by far, the best I've ever put into my mouth. It has a perfect blend of sweet and tart and is so pretty, thanks to numerous multi-colored veggies. But be ready for this to disappear before you put it on the table. I have 6 children, and it is all I can do to keep them from nibbling on it while I make it.</h2>
